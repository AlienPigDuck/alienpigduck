Been playing around with local LLMs recently.  I like having the ability to run models offline and experiment without relying on cloud services. Ollama is fantastic, and I was surprised to find my laptop can handle the models fine, albeit with a bit of a lag.  The one I've been using most is Dolphin-Llama3:8b.  Have had fun creating some Modelfiles to "impose" different personalities on the base model.  The base model is still available, but my Skippy LLM is a lot of fun.

Running the LLMs on the terminal is totally fine, but I've also been using Docker and Open WebUI for the front-end, and plan to experiment a bit with n8n next.  Open WebUI allows me to upload files which the LLMs can access. n8n looks very powerful but finding a use case for my simple self is a bit of a challenge...
